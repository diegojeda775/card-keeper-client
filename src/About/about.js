                    Hi. I'm a new developer. I built this app to keep improving my skils building a react client.
                    The inspiration for this app comes from playing trading card games since I was a little kid.
                    I still have some cards from 1996, which is the year when I learnt how to play Magic the Gathering.
                    I hope to develope more apps that can be useful to other people.
